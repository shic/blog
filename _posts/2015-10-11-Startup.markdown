# Growth Hacking

## Retention Rate 

Before hire a growth hacker or do GH, check your Retention Rate. If you have a low retention rate like the red line in the following graph,  go for  product market fit.

Idea 

product

team

execution

If you do not have a great product, no need to execute GH, because it will not growth.

The biggest problem of a startup is: they do not have actually product market fit.

Do not ask what is a good retention rate, because you should figure it out by yourself.
