# Git hook

1. Create `pre-commit` file in `.git/hooks`

2. Remember to change the access permissions: ` chmod +x pre-commit`

3. `pre-commit` file:

```bash
    gofiles=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '.go$')
    [ -z "$gofiles" ] && exit 0
    
    function checkfmt() {
      unformatted=$(gofmt -l $gofiles)
      [ -z "$unformatted" ] && return 0
    
      echo >&2 "Go files must be formatted with gofmt. Please run:"
      for fn in $unformatted; do
        echo >&2 "  gofmt -w $PWD/$fn"
      done
    
      return 1
    }
    
    checkfmt || fail=yes
    
    [ -z "$fail" ] || exit 1
    
    exit 0
    
```

4. You can link script to  `.git/hooks/pre-commit` if you want to commit script.

```
ln -s ../../pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Skip the pre-commit hook sometimes

Be aware of the `--no-verify` option to git commit. This bypasses the pre-commit hook when committing
